# 📘 Day 1 – React Bootcamp 🚀

Welcome to **Day 1** of my 7-Day React Bootcamp!  
Today was all about laying the groundwork — understanding how websites work, revisiting JavaScript basics, and setting up the development environment for React using Vite.

---
### 🔤 JavaScript Fundamentals To Be Revised
- `var`, `array`, `object`
- `if`, `else if`, `else` – Conditional logic
- `for` loop – Iteration
- `function` – Reusable code blocks
- **Higher Order Functions**:
  - `map()`
  - `filter()`
  - `forEach()`

## ✨ What I Learned Today

### 🌐 How a Website Works
- **Client**: Sends a request (browser)
- **Server**: Responds with data (HTML, JSON, etc.)
- **Frontend**: The part of the website users interact with
- **Backend**: Handles business logic, database, and server responses

---

### ⚛️ What is React?
- A **JavaScript library** developed by **Meta (Facebook)** for building **user interfaces**
- **React Native** – Used for building mobile applications
- **Electron** – Used for building desktop apps using web technologies

### 🛠️ Project Setup

| Tool        | Purpose                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Node.js     | JavaScript runtime for backend & tooling |
| npm         | Node package manager (comes with Node)   |
| Vite        | Fast build tool and dev server           |

#### ⚙️ Why Vite?
- Super fast dev environment
- Created by **Evan You** (also made Vue.js)
- Modern alternative to deprecated `create-react-app (CRA)`

---

### 🔗 Accessing Localhost (Default Vite Dev Server)

- `http://localhost:5173/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`
- `http://[::1]:5173/` (IPv6)

> 💡 `localhost` = your own computer  
> 💡 `5173` = default port used by Vite

### 🆚 Library vs Framework

| Aspect     | Library (React) | Framework (Vue, Angular) |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Flexibility| ✅ High         | ❌ Less                   |
| Security   | ❌ Less         | ✅ More                   |
| Opinionated| ❌ No           | ✅ Yes                    |
